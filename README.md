USGS Data Visualization Project
Overview
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) provides vital scientific data on natural hazards, ecosystems, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. This project aims to develop interactive visualizations of USGS data to help educate the public, support decision-making by government organizations, and promote further funding for environmental research.

Objective
This project focuses on visualizing USGS data in key areas:

Natural hazards (e.g., earthquakes, floods)
Ecosystem health (e.g., water quality, land cover)
Climate and land-use change impacts (e.g., urbanization, deforestation)
The goal is to make complex data accessible, engaging, and actionable, to raise awareness and inform policy.

Features
Interactive visualizations: Maps, charts, and time-series plots.
Geospatial mapping: Hazard zones, climate trends, ecosystem changes.
Trend analysis: Time-based data showing climate and land-use shifts.
Risk assessments: Visualize potential impacts (e.g., flood zones, earthquake risks).
Technologies
D3.js, Leaflet.js, Mapbox for interactive maps and visualizations.
Tableau / Power BI for data dashboards.
ArcGIS, Carto for geospatial analysis.
How to Use
Open the project in your browser or local environment.
Select the data type (e.g., earthquake, water quality).
Interact with maps and charts using filters and sliders.
Explore insights and share visualizations as needed.
Conclusion
This project aims to make USGS data more accessible and engaging, empowering users to understand and address critical environmental challenges.
